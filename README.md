**Architectural patterns** provide a high-level blueprint for solving common, large-scale design problems.
## Design patterns
**Design patterns** are specific, reusable solutions for more localized coding challenges.
## Design principles 
**Design principles** are guiding rules or best practices, like SOLID, that help create clean, maintainable, and scalable systems, and can sometimes imply or guide the use of specific patterns.
